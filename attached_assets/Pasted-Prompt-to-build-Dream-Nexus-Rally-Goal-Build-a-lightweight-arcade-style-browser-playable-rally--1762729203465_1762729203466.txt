Prompt to build “Dream Nexus Rally”

Goal
Build a lightweight, arcade-style, browser-playable rally game where Pixel the Bunny drives through stylized Colombian mountain roads. It must feel grounded (no floating tube roads), run smoothly on WebGL, and carry Dream Nexus branding. Keep scope small and shippable.

Core References / Assets (you will receive these):

Pixel character sprite/logo: [UPLOAD: pixel_bunny.png/svg]

Dream Nexus logo: [UPLOAD: dream_nexus_logo.svg]

Car sprite or low-poly mesh (simple): [UPLOAD: pixel_car.png or .glb]

Optional ambient track: [UPLOAD: music_loop.ogg]

Target Platform & Performance

Unity WebGL build (or your default engine for web in Gemini Studio).

60 FPS target on typical laptops; degrade gracefully.

Mobile WebGL compatible: touch controls mirrored to arrows.

Game Feel & Style

Visual style: clean, retro-arcade meets low-poly.

Palette: dark navy background (#0E1B24), cyan accents (#24A0CE), warm highlight (#FDC6B5).

Camera: third-person chase cam, fixed pitch, light spring smoothing.

No realistic sim; arcade handling with drift forgiveness.

Gameplay Loop (Simple & Fun)

Inputs: Up = accelerate, Down = brake/reverse, Left/Right = steer.

Car is locked to a flat road mesh (on-rails horizontally within lane width), so it can’t fall off. The mesh follows terrain undulations to feel grounded.

Procedural track: rolling S-curves, gentle hills; never self-intersect; no hard kinks; banking limited to mild.

Obstacles: cones, rocks, and puddles (slowdown only).

Collectibles (optional): “arequipe jars” = +score.

Difficulty ramps by increasing curve frequency & obstacle density every 30 seconds.

Failure: crash if speed > threshold and you hit obstacle head-on; otherwise speed penalty.

Endless runner scoring: meters traveled + collectibles. Global high score (localStorage).

Road/World Requirements (important)

Generate a flat lane-based road mesh with shoulders; width 8–10m; subtle per-segment elevation changes.

Terrain: low-poly hills with Colombian silhouettes (palms, wax palms, mountain shapes).

Sky: deep gradient; moving clouds; optional parallax distant mountains.

Absolutely no floating tube roads. The road reads as asphalt with a simple tiling material; add dashed center line.

Physics & Handling

Max speed ~ 220 km/h (display as number, but tune freely).

Acceleration curve snappy; drift assist to keep players on road.

Off-road slowdown if car leaves lane bounds (not a hard wall).

UI / Branding

Title screen: “Dream Nexus Rally — Help Pixel the Bunny race through Colombia!”

Controls shown (arrows/touch).

Start button (Enter/click).

In-game HUD (top-left): Distance (m), Speed, High Score.

Pause/resume (P / tap logo).

Game Over screen: distance, high score, “Play Again”.

Footer watermark with small Dream Nexus logo and “Sponsored by Dream Nexus”.

Audio (simple)

One music loop (toggle on/off).

SFX: engine hum (pitch by speed), pickup “ding”, crash “thud”, UI clicks.

Mobile Controls

On-screen left/right buttons and accelerate/brake; big tap targets; no submenus.

Accessibility

All text in high contrast; font: pixel/mono; color-blind safe collectibles.

Toggle for reduced motion.

Content Pipeline

Make the Pixel car a simple low-poly mesh or billboard sprite that can be swapped with [pixel_car.glb].

Provide an Inspector section (or clear constants) to tweak: lane width, obstacle rate, curve frequency, max speed.

Deliverables

Playable WebGL project with:

TitleScene → GameScene → GameOver.

Clean, commented code for:

TrackGenerator (flat mesh, curves, elevation noise, lane lines).

CarController (arcade, assists, speed/steer tuning).

Spawner (obstacles/collectibles with difficulty ramp).

UIManager (HUD, menus, high score via localStorage).

One cohesive art preset (materials, sky, mountains, palms).

Build settings ready for WebGL; pointer lock not required.

Hard Constraints / QA Checklist

✅ Road is a flat mesh attached to terrain, not a floating tube.

✅ Car can’t leave world bounds or flip; no jitter.

✅ No spikes in difficulty; curves never exceed 90° within 20m.

✅ Runs in desktop Chrome/Safari/Edge and mobile Chrome/Safari.

✅ High score persists across sessions.

Nice-to-Have (only if time left)

Simple “sponsor banners” along track using [dream_nexus_logo.svg].

Weather variants: sunny / overcast (just sky + fog tweaks).

Photo mode: freeze + hide UI.

Placeholders to replace with my assets

[pixel_bunny.png/svg] for mascot in title + HUD corner.

[dream_nexus_logo.svg] for title/footer and banners.

[pixel_car.glb] (else generate a simple low-poly car).

[music_loop.ogg] (else use silence).

Summary
Ship a tight, polished, endless arcade rally with grounded roads, Colombian vibes, Pixel the Bunny as the hero, and Dream Nexus branding. Prioritize smooth feel, readable visuals, and web performance over complexity.
